<div class="scene-description">
<p>The flat roof of <span class="speaker">Jeremiah&rsquo;s</span> house; the white flagstones
gleam in the dim moonlight. Below are seen
the towers and battlements of sleeping Jerusalem.
Nothing stirs, save that from time to time we hear
the whispering of the breeze that heralds the dawn.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, impetuous footsteps sound upon the
stair. <span class="speaker">Jeremiah</span> staggers in; his robe is torn open
at the throat; he gasps like one being strangled.</p>
</div>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>They batter in the gates &hellip; to the walls &hellip; to the
walls!&hellip; Faithless watchmen &hellip; they are coming &hellip;
they are upon us&hellip;. The temple is in
flames&hellip;. Help, help!&hellip; The walls are breached&hellip;.
[<span class="stage-direction">He has rushed forward to the edge of the roof, where
he abruptly stops. His cry rends the shimmering
silence. With a start, he awakens from his trance.
He looks forth over the town like a drunken man; his
arms, which in his terror he has raised, sink slowly to
his sides; then wearily he draws his hand across his
open eyes</span>] Illusion! Once again these terrible visions.
Full, how full, is the House of Dreams! [<span class="stage-direction">He
leans on the parapet and gazes down</span>] Peace broods
over the city; the country is at peace; in me alone, in
my breast alone, this fire rages. How quietly the
town reposes in God&rsquo;s arms, nestling in slumber, roofed
over by peace, the moonbeams falling on every house,
and every house plunged in gentle sleep. But I, I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
alone, am consumed with fire night after night; I crash
earthward with the falling towers, rush to escape, perish
amid the flames; I, and none but I, my bowels
troubled, leap heated from my bed and stagger forth
into the moonlight seeking coolness! For me alone
comes a vision to shatter sleep; for me alone does a
fiery horror wrench the darkness from my lids. The
martyrdom of this vision; the madness of these faces
which swarm in their blood-stained multitude and then
fade in the clear moonlight!</p>

<p>Always the same dream, the same illusion. Night
after night, the same terror seizes me, the same dream,
culminating in the same torment. Who has instilled
this dream poison into my veins? Who hunts me
thus with terror? Who covets my sleep, that he must
rob me of it; who is my torturer, and for whom must
I thus hold vigil? Answer! Who art thou, invisible one,
aiming at me from the darkness thy wingèd shafts?
Who art thou, terror incarnate, coming to lie with me
by night, quickening me with thy spirit until my frame
is twisted as with labor pains? Wherefore in this
slumbering city should the curse be laid on me alone?
[<span class="stage-direction">He is silent, straining his ear to the all-pervading
silence, and then continues with growing excitement</span>]
Silence, nothing but silence, while within is unceasing
turmoil and storm-tossed night. With scorching talons
it tears at my vitals and yet cannot grasp them. I am
scourged with visions, and know not who holds the
scourge. My cries go forth into the void. Desist,
invisible hunter, or if it must be otherwise, seize your
quarry; call to me when I wake, not when I sleep;
speak to me in words, not in visions. Reveal what you
are hiding from me; tell me the meaning of these
torments.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>A Voice</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Calling softly from the darkness. It seems to
come from far above or far beneath, mysterious in its
remoteness</span>] Jeremiah!</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Staggers as if struck by a stone</span>] Who calls?
Surely I heard my name? Was it a voice from the
stars, or was it the voice of my own dream? [<span class="stage-direction">He
listens. All is quiet again</span>] Is it thou, invisible one,
who huntest me and tormentest me? Or is it I myself;
is it the fierce current of my own blood? Voice, speak
once more, that I may know thee. Call to me once
again.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Voice</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Drawing nearer</span>] Jeremiah!</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Quailing, sinks to his knees</span>] Here am I, Lord!
Thy servant heareth. [<span class="stage-direction">Breathless he hearkens.
Nothing stirs; he trembles with emotion</span>] Speak, Lord,
to thy servant. Thou didst call my name. Give me
thy message that I may understand it. I am ready for
thy word and await thy command. [<span class="stage-direction">He listens again
with strained attention. Profound silence</span>] Is it
presumption that I should long for thee? I am no
more than an ignorant fellow, a man of no account, a
speck of dust in the world thou hast made, but thine
is all power of choice. Thou who choosest kings from
among shepherds, and who often unsealest the lips of
a boy so that he glows with thy speech, thy choice is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>
made by other tokens. Whom thou touchest, Lord, he
is chosen; whom thou choosest, Lord, he is appointed.
If it were thy call which came to me, lo I have
hearkened to the call. If it be thou, Lord, who
huntest me, I flee thee not. Seize thy quarry, Lord,
seize thy prey; or hunt me yet farther to the goal!
But make thyself known, that I may not fail thee;
reveal the heaven of thy word, that I, thy servant, may
behold thee!</p>

<p class="speaker">The Voice</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Nearer and more urgent</span>] Jeremiah!</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Rapturously</span>] I hear, Lord, I hear. With all my
soul I listen to thy word. Unworthy vessel that I am,
I wait to be filled with thy message. I vow myself to
thy service, Lord, to thine alone, for my soul is athirst
to serve thee. I await thy word and thy sign.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Voice of Jeremiah&rsquo;s Mother</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Now close at hand and plainly recognizable</span>]
Jeremiah!</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">In ecstasy</span>] Show thyself to me, Lord; my heart
is racked with the imminence of thy coming. Pour
forth thy waters, holy storm; plough me up, that I
may bear thy seed; make my earth fruitful, inspire my
lips; brand me with the mark of thy service! Set thy
yoke upon me. See, my neck is bowed in readiness,
for thine am I, thine for evermore. Make thyself
known to me, Lord, even as I know thee; let me but
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>
see thy glory, even as thou lookest down upon my
unworthiness in the gloom; deign only to show me the
way of thy will, point the way to him who is thy
servant for ever!</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Her search has led her up the stair; her countenance
shows anxiety, her voice is full of tenderness</span>]
Here at last I find you, my son.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Springing to his feet in fear and wrath</span>] Begone!
Alas the voices are stilled; the way is lost, never shall
I find it again.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>Woe is me, why do you stand here so thinly clad in
the chill night air? Come down, my son. The
morning mist brings fever.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Wildly</span>] Why do you follow me, why do you
pester me? Unending chase. You follow me without
pause, waking or sleeping.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>Jeremiah, what do you mean? I was sleeping
below, and then I seemed to hear people talking on the
roof.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>You heard, you too? God&rsquo;s holy truth! You
heard him speak? Understood his call?</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>The Mother</p>

<p>Whom do you mean? You have no companion.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Seizing her arm</span>] Mother, tell me I beseech you.
Death or joy hangs upon your words. Did you hear a
voice; did you hear it after you had awakened?</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>I heard a voice on the roof and went to summon you.
But your bed was cold and empty. Then fear came
upon me, and I called your name.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Trembling</span>] You called my name?</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>Thrice did I call you. But why&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Thrice? Mother, are you certain&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>Thrice did I call you.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">His voice breaking</span>] Disaster and derision! Fraud
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11"> </a>
everywhere, without and within. There came an
earnest call, and in my terror I thought it was God.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>How strange you are! I meant no harm. Since
there was no answer, I came to the roof to see if there
was anyone here. I found no one.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Nay, you found a madman. The torture of these
visions! Sense and nonsense join in cheating me. I
am befooled by my own fantasy.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>What are you talking about? What is troubling
you?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Nothing, Mother, nothing. Pay no heed to my
words.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>I must heed them, Jeremiah; but they are dark to
me. An evil mood has beset you, and has estranged
you from me. What has happened; what is tormenting
you?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Nothing is tormenting me, Mother. I was too hot
in bed, and sought the roof for coolness.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>The Mother</p>

<p>You are closing your heart to me, and yet I can read
you. I know that night after night for months past
you have been wandering about. I have often heard
you groaning in your sleep. When you have left
your bed to walk restlessly in the darkness, my heart
has followed your every step. Tell me your troubles.
Shut not yourself away from me.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Do not concern yourself about it, Mother.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>How can I help but concern myself about it? Are
you not the day of my days and the prayer of my
nights? You have outgrown the arms which used to
carry you; but I still hold you in my soul, which
watches over your life. I knew, ere you yourself were
aware; I saw months ago, before you yourself had
seen. I saw the shadow upon your brow and the
anguish of your soul. You have become a stranger to
your friends; you shun merrymakings; you keep away
from the marketplace and from the dwellings of men.
Buried in thought, you renounce life. Jeremiah,
bethink yourself. You were trained for the priesthood.
Your father&rsquo;s mantle awaits you, that you may
praise the Lord with psaltery and song. Look forth
from the darkness into the daylight. The hour has
come for you to begin your life&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Not now the time for beginnings. The end draws
nigh.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>The Mother</p>

<p>It is time! It is time! Long since have you grown
to manhood. The house has need of a wife, and of
children to raise up seed to your father.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">In bitter distress</span>] Lead a wife home to desolation?

<p>I do not understand.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Shall I build a house in the abyss? Shall I build
my life in death? Shall I sow corruption, and sing
the praises of disaster? I say unto you, Mother,
blessed is he whose heart is now free from ties to the
living, for whosoever breathes this day is already
drinking the waters of death.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>What mad fancy has seized you? When were the
times more propitious? When was the land more
peaceful?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>No, Mother, the fools say: Peace, Peace. But their
words do not bring peace. They lie down to sleep
unheeding, and as they sleep they are on their way to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>
death. A time is coming such as Israel has never yet
known, a war such as the world has never yet seen.
The living will covet the peace of the dead in their
graves, and those who can see will envy the darkness
with which the blind are stricken. Not yet can the
fools see, not yet is it manifest to the dreamers; but I
have beheld it night after night. Higher leap the
flames, nearer comes the foe; the day of tumult and
destruction is at hand; war&rsquo;s red star is rising on the
night.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>How can I? My own despair is the greatest of all.
Leave me, Mother, leave me!</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>I will not leave you, neither will I abandon your
soul to despair. Jeremiah, my only son, hearken to
me. For the first time let me tell you something
which may awaken your courage. Hear the words
that are forced from me by my distress. I, too, was
once filled with despair, inasmuch as for ten years the
Lord had closed my womb. I was the sport of my
companions and the mock of the concubines. For ten
long years I bore my lot patiently, and had almost
given up hope; but in the eleventh year my heart was
kindled, and I went to the house of God to implore
him that my womb should bear fruit. Throwing myself
on the ground, I watered it with tears, vowing
that if a son were vouchsafed me I would devote him
to the Lord&rsquo;s service. I swore to be silent, to utter no
word during my time of trial, that my son in days to
come might speak abundantly, praising God.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>The Mother</p>

<p>The selfsame day your father knew me and I was
blessed with you. Hearken, Jeremiah. For nine
months did I faithfully refrain from speech that you
might speak abundantly, that you might glorify the
everlasting God! Thus did I fulfil my vow, and we
brought you up to read the scripture, and sweetly did
you sing to the psaltery. Know, then, that from the
first you were a consecrated priest and devoted to the
service of the Lord. Rend the veil of your dreams
and come forth into the daylight.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>A double consecration, Mother, a twofold witness of
this night. A second time you have called me to life.
Through your words the light has come to me, for,
wonderful to relate, I cried my question to God and he
sent you to speak to me! Now do I know who
knocked on the wall of my sleep until I awakened from
my life&rsquo;s slumber; now do I know who summoned me.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>What has befallen you? Your words are like those
of a drunken man.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Yea, drunk am I now with the certainty of his will;
so full am I of speech, that the words must forth. The
seals upon my mouth are broken, and my lips burn to
utter the revelation.</p>

son, with a fate like unto yours! Learn that I too
have been barren, and that the Lord hath quickened me
with a word and a secret. I have renewed your vow,
Mother, and have given myself to the Lord.</p>

<p>Nay, Mother, not for me the service of the sacrificial
priest. I myself must be the sacrifice. For God
my veins run blood; for him my flesh is consumed; for
him my soul burns. I will serve him as none ever
served him before; his paths shall henceforward be
mine. Behold the dawn upon the valley, and within
me likewise is darkness dispelled by light! God&rsquo;s
heaven flames, and in me no less the heart is aflame.

<p>The great square of Jerusalem. Thence a broad
long flight of steps leads to the porch of pillars of the
fortress of Zion; on the right is the king&rsquo;s palace and
in the center the adjoining temple. On the other side
the great square is bounded by houses and streets which
seem low and mean in contrast with the towering structures
facing them. The walls of the entrances to the
palace are lined with cedar, carved with figures of
cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, all overlaid
with gold; there are lavers in the foreground with
running water. In the background are seen the brazen
gates of the temple.</p>

<p>In front of the palace, in the streets and on the stairway,
the people of Jerusalem move to and fro confusedly;
a motley mass of men, women, and children,
swayed by strong excitement, and in eager expectation.
Many voices rise from the crowd, usually in animated

<p class="speaker">Zebulon</p>

<p>Never was Mizraim the friend of Israel.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>Our shame is theirs, and Israel&rsquo;s need is Egypt&rsquo;s.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zebulon</p>

<p>Naught have we in common with any other folk on

<p class="speaker">The Other</p>

for itself alone.</p>

<p>Are we still to be slaves? Shall Zedekiah be a king
of slaves, and Zion remain in bondage to Chaldea?
Were but Zedekiah a true king!</p>

<p class="speaker">Zebulon</p>

<p>Silence, I command you. It befits not a boy to lay
down the law for kings.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>It is true that I am young; but who is Jerusalem,
if it be not her young men? It was not the cautious
elders who built Jerusalem. David, young David,
established her towers, and made her great among
the nations.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zebulon</p>

<p>Hold your peace. You have no right to speak in
the marketplace.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>Shall only the cautious elders speak, none but the
aged give counsel, that Israel may grow old before
her time and God&rsquo;s word decay in our hearts? The
moment is ours, and it is for us to take revenge. You
have abased yourselves, and we will lift ourselves up;
you have faltered, but we will bring fruition; you
had peace, and we want war.</p>

passive, now that the Lord hath summoned you? God
is athirst, for his pitchers are empty; God is anhungered,
for his altars are broken; God is cold, for the
hangings of the temple have been stolen; God suffers,

thy heels, bring back my stolen goods, deliver me as I
deliver thee. Reject those who would counsel thee

dreams. He has filled my nights with horror, and has
awakened me at due time; he has given me a mouth
that I may speak and a voice that I may cry aloud. He
has breathed dismay into my mind that I may spread
it over you like a burning cloth. I will utter my dismay

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">From the top of the steps</span>] Brothers in Israel,
brothers in Jerusalem, in my dream I heard a storm
burst upon the city, and I saw warriors assail our walls.
The pillars fell and the battlements were laid low.
Fire sat upon the roofs like a red beast devouring our
dwellings. No stone was left standing upon another,
and the streets were laid waste. I saw the dead lying
in heaps upon the ground, so that my heart was turned
within me and my mouth was unsealed even in sleep.</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p>Madness is crying from the steps of the temple.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>The falling sickness afflicts him, and he in turn
afflicts us.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>Baruch</p>

<p>Down with him.</p>

<p class="speaker">Voices</p>

<p>No, we want to hear his dreams.&mdash;What do they
mean?&mdash;He is a madman.&mdash;He is a fool.&mdash;Away with
him!</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>But, brothers, when I awakened in the sweat of my
body, I mocked myself even as you mock me now. Did
not peace brood over the land; were not the walls
untouched, so that no breeze stirred athwart them? I
went forth from the house full of shame for my own
terrors; I sought the marketplace that I might rejoice
in its peace. But when I came thither I heard shouts
of exultation; and my heart broke within me, for the
shouts were clamors for war. Brothers, my soul was
bitter as gall, and the words came to my lips against
my will. Tell me, is war so precious that you should
praise it? Is it so kindly that you should long for it?
Does it bring so much good that you should greet it
with all the warmth of your heart? I say unto you,
people of Jerusalem, that war is a fierce and evil beast,
one that devours the flesh of the strong and sucks the
marrow of the mighty, crushing towns in its jaws and
trampling the land beneath its hoofs. Those who
awaken it, shall not again lay it to sleep; and he who
draws the sword, is like to perish by the sword. Woe,
therefore, to the contentious man who quarrels when
there is no need, for he shall come out upon one way,
and flee upon seven. Woe to those who murder peace
with the words of their mouth. Beware of all such,
O people of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>Baruch</p>

<p>Beware of cowards, O people of Jerusalem; beware
of traitors in the pay of the enemy.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>What promise does he bring? Where is God&rsquo;s word?
He speaks for Babylon and for Baal.</p>

<p class="speaker">Voices</p>

<p>No, no.&mdash;His words are just.&mdash;There is much truth
in what he says.&mdash;Let him deliver his message.&mdash;Dreams.&mdash;Where
is the promise?&mdash;Go on.&mdash;We want
to hear him too.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Why do you awaken the ravening beast with your
shouts. Why do you summon the king of the north
to your city? Why do you clamor for war, men of
Jerusalem? Did you beget your sons for slaughter,
and your daughters for shame? Did you build your
houses for destruction by fire, and your walls for the
battering ram? Bethink thee, Israel; call a halt ere
thou runnest into the darkness, Jerusalem. Is thy
slavery so hard, are thy sorrows beyond assuagement?
Look around. God&rsquo;s sun shines over the land; the vines
bloom in peace; lovers walk happily together; children
play unhindered; the moon shines gently over the sleep
of Jerusalem. Fire and water keep their appointed
places, the storehouses are well filled, and God has his
spacious mansion. Say, Israel, is it not well with thee
within the walls of Zion; art thou not blithe in the
valleys of Sharon; art thou not happy by the blue
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>
waters of Jordan? Let it suffice thee to live at peace
under God&rsquo;s tranquil gaze. Hold fast to peace, people
of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zebulon</p>

<p>His words are just! Hail unto him. His speech is
golden.</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p class="speaker">Voices</p>

<p>Yes, he has been bribed.&mdash;No, his words are just.&mdash;Peace.&mdash;We
want peace.&mdash;He is a traitor.&mdash;He is in
the pay of Ashur.&mdash;Let him speak.&mdash;No, Hananiah is
right.&mdash;Let us listen to Hananiah.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>Away with you, away. Go, talk to Samaria, the land
of slaves. Deliver your message to Moab, or to the
uncircumcised, but not to Israel, God&rsquo;s first-born among
the nations.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Menacingly, to <span class="speaker">Jeremiah</span></span>] Answer me, in face of

paying tribute?&mdash;Answer.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>Jeremiah</p>

<p>Loudly do I speak my mind before the people. It is
better to pay tribute of gold to the enemy than tribute
of blood to war. It is better to be wise than powerful;
it is better to be the servant of God than the ruler of
men.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>Man of servile obedience, slave of Chaldea, will you
deny God&rsquo;s word which commandeth war against the
oppressor; will you deny his holy word?</p>

<p>But it is also written: &ldquo;In returning and rest shall
ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be
your strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="speaker">Voices</p>

<p>Yes, thus is it written.&mdash;He speaks truth.&mdash;His
words are the words of wisdom.&mdash;Nay, he twists the
scripture to his own purpose.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>This is written of an unholy war, of dissension among
the brethren of Israel. But ours is a holy war, a war
of God waged in the everlasting name of Jerusalem, a
war of God, a war of God.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Couple not God&rsquo;s name with war. Not God makes
war, but man. No war is holy; no death is holy; life
alone is holy.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>Baruch</p>

<p>You lie! Life is given us that we may sacrifice it

rule upon earth. Never shall Israel be vanquished so
long as all her sons share these thoughts.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>Never shall Israel be vanquished while God&rsquo;s stars

<p>Keep still a moment, that I may wipe the blood

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

Your eyes flashed fiercely. Was it not you who struck

<p>I indeed it was who drew sword upon you in anger,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>

an unarmed man. I will pay blood-money. Let me
staunch your wound.</p>

<p>Let the blood flow. Would that mine alone were
to flow in Jerusalem. [<span class="stage-direction">Half rising</span>] What has become

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>They have gone. It is too late. Curse upon you

more, than me have you slain. Not my blood alone

you, Zion has been broken and destroyed. You have

cry aloud. Help me to save Zion from destruction.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

me. I had believed you a weakling, and therefore did
I oppose you as one who shunned action and favored
the easy path of peace.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>The easy path of peace! Do you fancy that peace
is not action, that peace is not the action of all actions?
Day by day you must wrest it from the mouths of
liars and from the hearts of men. You must stand
alone against the multitude; for clamor is always on
the side of the many, and the liar has ever the first
word. The meek must be strong; those who desire
peace are continually at war.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>But you will not go alone?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>I must go, I must go. I must make my words good.

with his life. Let me publish my visions; let me proclaim
my warning before the king.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

Jerusalem needs help in this hour. Come, then,
Baruch, first-born of my faith, son of my anguish,
support me that we may testify together. My anguish

His expression is grave. Amid the exultant crowd he

with slow strides. Suddenly, above the clamor of the

went they forth, to deal death and to suffer it; their
backs were bent beneath the weight of their weapons;
the shadow of death fell across their path, and all but
the strongest fainted by the way. Where they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" title="90"> </a>

among you is to dwell among scorpions; but I say unto
you that your laughter shall wither more quickly than
the blossoms of the vine. God has been gracious to
you. Again has he saved Jerusalem; yet not for your
laughter, but for the sake of those who are humble in
spirit. You will not acknowledge him in his gentleness,
men of evil. So be it; ere long shall you
acknowledge him in his wrath. Like a curtain shall
he rend your laughter asunder, and in your terror your
eyes shall become fixed like stones. Your joy then
must you put behind you, Jerusalem, for the hour of
retribution is at hand, and terrible is the doom that
awaits you.</p>

<p>I must go alone to seek light from the Lord. He
made me deliver a sign before the people. Nevertheless,
Baruch, I cannot believe that the faces in my
ghastly visions are truly from God. Would that I
could feel assured they are all illusion, and not the
message of God&rsquo;s spirit. Woe indeed if I be chosen
as revealer and if my dreams be true.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>You are chosen, master. It has been made plain to
me in this hour. The sign came to you from God.

Tempt me not! For Israel&rsquo;s sake, for Jerusalem&rsquo;s
sake, it is impossible that my words can be true. Far
better for me to bear the laughter and the scorn of the
people, than that this message of terror should be fulfilled.
Rather let me be proved liar and fool, than
the prophet of such a truth. May I be thy victim
Lord, and not this city. Let me disappear into the
darkness of oblivion, if thy towers may still shine, O
Jerusalem. May my words vanish like smoke, so
long as thou endurest, eternal city. God forget me,
if he will but remember thee. I will kneel before his
altar praying him to give me the lie; I will beseech
him to prove my message false. Pray with me,
Baruch, that I be known for a liar in Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="scene-description">
<p>On the ramparts of Jerusalem. The walls, of hewn
stone, surround the town. In the background is the
starry sky, and faint in the distance the valley with
hazy outlines and lights twinkling here and there.
The masonry shines in the moonlight. On the wall
two sentries march up and down. Their faces are
shadowed by their helmets; their spears gleam as they
move. Though the hour is late and midnight approaches,
a few civilians have ventured on to the wall
and are looking out into the distance.</p>

<p class="speaker">A Man</p>

<p>How can one sleep when the enemy is arrayed
against us? My heart has been heavier than lead
since I have been standing here; and yet I cannot leave.
It seems as if I were forced to remain in the flood
which is rising to overwhelm us. Last night and
to-day the horsemen have been streaming across the
plain. Again and again we thought that all must have
come, but still there came more and yet more, as if
whole countries had been emptied like sacks of grain;
while the spears were as the stalks of the corn in
number.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">The two sentries are silent for a while, marching
to and fro</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Stands and listens</span>] Do you hear?</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>The sound is very faint, but the breeze bears it to
us. When I was in Joppa, for the first time I heard
in the night the distant murmur of the waves. Such a
sound rises now from the plain. They are there in
their thousands, moving quietly, but the air is stirred
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108"> </a>
by the rolling wheels and the clashing arms. A whole
nation must be afoot, falling upon Israel. The noise
echoes from our walls like the noise of the sea.</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Obdurately</span>] I refuse to hear anything but my
orders. I care not what wheels roll, or noises stir.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>Why does God hurl the nations against one another?
There is room for all beneath the skies. There is still
plenty of land unploughed; many forests still await
the axe. Yet men turn their ploughshares into swords,
and hew living flesh with their axes. I cannot understand,
I cannot understand.</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>It has always been so.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>But must it always be so? Why does God wish the
nations to fight?</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>The nations want war for its own sake.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>What are nations? Are not you one of our nation,
am not I another? Are not our wives, your wife and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>
mine, part of this same people? Did any of us want
war? I stand here armed with a spear, not knowing
against whom it is to be turned. Down there in the
darkness, unwitting, waits the man for whom it is
destined. I know him not, have never seen his face,
or the breast I must pierce with death. In the enemy&rsquo;s
camp another perchance warms his hands at the camp
fire, the man who is to kill the father of my children.
He has never seen me, and I have never done him
harm. We are strangers, like trees in the forest. They
grow quietly and bear their blossoms. But we rage
furiously one against the other with axe and with
spear, until our blood runs like resin, and therewith
the life oozes forth. What puts death between the
nations? What is it which sows hatred when there is
room and to spare for life, and when there is abundant
scope for love? I cannot understand, I cannot understand!</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>These things must be God&rsquo;s will, for they have
always happened. I question no further.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>This crime cannot be God&rsquo;s will. He has given us
our lives that we may live them. Everything that men
do not understand they describe as God&rsquo;s will. War
does not come from God. Whence comes it then?</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>How can I tell whence it comes? I know that there
is war, and that it is useless to chatter about it. I do
my duty; sharpen my spear, not my tongue.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" title="110"> </a>[<span class="stage-direction">For a time they are silent once more, gazing out
into the white stillness. From a great distance come the
words of the challenge &ldquo;<em>Samson guard us</em>,&rdquo; scarcely
audible at first. Then the sound grows louder, still
coming from unseen sentries. At length the words
&ldquo;<em>Samson guard us</em>,&rdquo; loud and clear from the next
post. Our two sentries take up the challenge, and it
is heard with diminishing loudness as it passes on round
the wall. Again all is still. The two sentries stand
silent in the moonlight, their faces shadowed by their
helmets</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>Know you aught of the Chaldeans?</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>I know that they are our enemies, that they are
attacking our homes.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>I am not thinking about that. Have you ever seen
any of them close at hand; do you know their customs
and their country?</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>I have been told that they are cruel as wild cats and
venomous as serpents. It is said that they sacrifice their
children to idols of copper and lead. But I have never
set eyes on a Chaldean.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>Nor I. Too many mountains tower skyward between
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" title="111"> </a>
Jerusalem and Babylon; there are rivers to cross, and
more country than a man can march over in many weeks.
The very stars in the sky are different, and yet the men
of Ashur are arrayed against us and we against them.
What do they covet from us? If I were to question
one of them, all he could tell me would doubtless be
that in his house as in mine are wife and children lying
upon straw. I believe if I could talk things over with
such a man we should understand one another well
enough. Often I feel that I should like to summon
one of them, to hold out a friendly hand, so that we
could have a heart to heart talk.</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>You must not do that.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>Wherefore not?</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>They are our enemies and it is our duty to hate them.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>Why should I hate them if my heart knows no reason
for hatred?</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>They began the war; they were the aggressors.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>Yes, that is what we say in Jerusalem. In Babylon,
perchance, they tell another story. If we could talk
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a>
things over with them, we might get some light on the
question.</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>You must not talk with them. Our duty is to strike
them down. Such are our orders, and we must obey.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>My reason tells me that I must not converse with
them, but in my soul I feel that I must. Whom do we
serve by compassing their death?</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>What a question, simpleton! We serve God, and the
king our master.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>But God said, and it is written: &ldquo;Thou shalt not
kill&rdquo;. Mayhap, if I were to take my sword and cast it
from me, I should serve God better than by slaying an
enemy.</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>But it is likewise written: &ldquo;Eye for eye, tooth for
tooth&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Sighs</span>] Many things are written. Who can understand
them all?</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>This is idle dreaming. The Chaldeans have invested
our town; they wish to burn our houses; I stand here
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>
with sword and spear, and will do my utmost to prevent
them. Too much knowledge is unwholesome. I
know all I want to know.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>Yet I cannot but ask myself&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Stubbornly</span>] You should not ask so many questions.
A soldier&rsquo;s business is to fight, not to reason why.
You ponder overmuch, instead of doing your duty
unquestioningly.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>How can a man help questioning himself? How
can he be other than uneasy, at such an hour? Do I
know where I am, or how long I have still to stand on
guard? This darkness beneath the wall, where the
masonry is crumbling, will perhaps be my grave
to-morrow. Maybe the wind which now caresses my
cheek will not find me here in the morning. But can
I fail, while I live, to ask the meaning of life? The
flame flickers until the torch goes out. How can life
do other than question until it is quenched by death?
Maybe death is already within me; perchance the questioner
is no longer life, but death.</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>You brood and brood. You are only tormenting
yourself to no purpose.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>Second Sentry</p>

<p>God has given us a heart precisely that it may torment
us.</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sentry</p>

<p>What is the use of talking about it? We are on
guard here. That&rsquo;s enough for me.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Sentry</p>

<p>Talking helps to keep us awake, and only the stars
hear our words.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Still gazing</span>] The king has come, the king from

Baruch! Touch my hand that I may know whether I
wake or sleep. Are my eyes open? Is this wall builded
of stones or of tears? Does Jerusalem lie behind us
unheeding in the darkness? Are the forces of Ashur
couched in the plain beneath? Tell me, Baruch, convince
me that I am dreaming. Shake me till I awake,
to laugh at my mad fancy that Zion is encircled by the
Chaldeans.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>What do you mean, master? I don&rsquo;t understand.
How can you doubt?</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>Jeremiah</p>

<p>Alas, it is true, then. I am not dreaming now. The
horses are there and the chariots; Ashur is arrayed
against Zion; the vision is fulfilled. All these miseries
spring from my dreams, for they existed in me before
they were in the world of reality. I alone knew, before
ever God&rsquo;s words became deeds. In me they arose;
through me they came. Yet naught can I do to hinder
their flow; nor by sword nor by shield can I stay their
progress.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>Master, you talk at random. Speak in words that
I can believe and understand.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Words that you can believe? But Baruch will you
believe the words that I have to say to you at this hour
beneath the stars? I fear you will deny me, will laugh
at me, for what I would fain say will sound like nonsense
in your ears.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>Faith in you is my very life.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Hearken, then. [<span class="stage-direction">He speaks low and impressively</span>]
All that is now happening, I have beheld in my dreams
for months past. Not a star shines in heaven which I
have not seen above this wall and above God&rsquo;s temple.
I have looked down upon the multitude of the foe,
upon their myriad tents. Baruch, do you hear me?</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117"> </a>Baruch</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Shuddering</span>] I hear, I hear.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Why was all this made plain to me before the day?
It cannot be against God&rsquo;s will that he should disclose
his plans to me, should vouchsafe me visions of the
future. Nor can I rebel; nor can I be silent; though
in truth for long I refused the summons, and stopped
my ears to the call. But now, when I see in the real
world what has again and again been revealed to me
in dreams, for the first time do I feel assured that God
speaks through me. I say to you, Baruch, that I am
the chosen of the Lord. Woe unto me should I conceal
my forebodings from the people and from the king.
For this is no more than the beginning, and I know
the end.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>Reveal it, chosen one. Cry your words aloud.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Baruch, do you see the camp and the tents; do you
see this sleeping ocean surging down from the north?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Shuddering</span>] I see the enemy; I see the tents.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>You see the night, sleep, and the false quiet of
repose. But in my ears the trumpets blare and the arms
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" title="118"> </a>
clash as the Chaldeans arise and storm the city. The
walls whereon our feet are now planted, crumble at
their onslaught; the cries of the fugitives ring in my
ears. The brazen flood foams over us. I hear the
beating of Death&rsquo;s wings o&rsquo;er city and walls; I see the
destruction of Zion. Baruch, waking I see it, for God
hath opened an eye within the darkness of my body;
my heart maketh a noise in me; my soul hath heard the
sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. Why sleep
they still? Time is it they should wake, ere their sleep
pass into death. Verily the hour is come to awaken
Jerusalem!</p>

<p>See how the camp fires burn athwart the plain. It
looks as if the black heavens had fallen upon earth,
whence star after star now shines forth. A people
countless in numbers is encamped round Israel. Spears
are leveled; hands are raised; even in sleep, their
dreams turn against us. To-morrow they will all arise
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_122" title="122"> </a>

night of peaceful slumber.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>Be not despondent, O king. Upon this very wall
where now thou standest sorely troubled, stood aforetime
King Hezekiah. His mind, likewise, was full of
care, for in the plain beneath, wave upon wave, countless
like these, lay the hosts of Senaccherib. Then,
as now, the flood of Ashur threatened the holy city.
But the Lord stretched forth his hand and smote the
enemy with a pestilence. These walls shall never be
broken. Jerusalem endureth for <ins title="ever">ever.</ins></p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Nay, bring him hither. I wish to see him. I wish
to see that he who spoke was a living man. Terrible
was the sound of his voice. It seemed to me as if the

the words issued from the very walls.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">The two sentries hasten away into the darkness</span>]</p>

<p>Israel is verily astray, but not by my leadership.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>I know thy voice. My heart tells me that I have

Was it thou who criedst aloud for peace at the portal of
the palace?</p>

<p>Yea, Lord, it was I.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Many voices assailed my ears in that hour, but when
I had returned home at nightfall and lay sleepless on
my couch, it was thy call which dinned in my ears.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s will was that thou shouldst hearken. Woe unto
thee that thou heardest not. Had it been otherwise
there would be sleep on thy lids and peace in Israel.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">To <span class="speaker">Jeremiah</span></span>] What make you here on the wall

<p>His mother is on her deathbed, for his words have

<p>Be silent, all. My soul is not so weak that I can be
swayed by the words of chatterers. Fear not, Jeremiah,
I heard thy voice on the day when we decided upon
war. It resounded in my heart, for a word of peace
is the word of God. But the past is past. War now
rages between Ashur and Israel. Words no longer
avail. I cannot stop the war at will.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Nay, Lord, but thou canst.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Wrathfully</span>] How, tell me how? Dost thou not

<p>Send envoys, while there is yet time to save

<p>Better to be followed by the laughter of fools than
by the tears of widows. Think not of thyself; but of
the people, which God hath appointed thee to lead.
Do God&rsquo;s will, though fools laugh. Thou hast raised
thy head against Ashur. Humble thyself now before

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Humble myself?</p>

<div class="scene-description">
<p>The small bed-chamber where <span class="speaker">Jeremiah&rsquo;s Mother</span>
lies ill. Doorways and windows are covered with curtains
to exclude light and sound. The interior is so
dark that the figures of those in the chamber are barely
visible. The white bed-furniture is conspicuous in the
gloom. Close to the bed stands <span class="speaker">Ahab</span>, the elderly
servingman.</p>
</div>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">A female relative, coming from without, <ins title="cautionsly">cautiously</ins>
draws aside the curtain over the doorway</span>] Ahab!</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Speak low! Tread softly! Her sleep is light as
thistle-down. A breath will scatter it.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>Well for one who can still sleep, when the gates of
the city are being assailed.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Not a word of the matter. Not a word of the
enemy. As you love her, spare her.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>What do you mean? What must I not speak of?</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" title="142"> </a>Ahab</p>

<p>Not a word of our troubles. She knows naught of
Jerusalem&rsquo;s evil plight.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand. She does not know that the
town is besieged?</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Why should we tell her what is impending? The
very thought would kill her.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Greatly astonished</span>] She does not know that Ashur
is upon us? Is there still a living being within the
walls who remains ignorant of our misery? How has
this miracle been wrought? Are her senses closed?
Is she deaf to the hosannas? Does she think we are at
peace when the battering rams thunder against the
walls?</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Her senses are dulled. Such noises as she hears
seem the noises of a dream. I have closed the entries,
shutting out sound and light.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>She knows nothing? Wonderful, and yet horrible.
Has she no suspicion?</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" title="143"> </a>Ahab</p>

<p>At times she has suspected, but I have been able to
calm her fears. Yesterday, when the first rams were
at work, she was alarmed by the cries of the populace.
Throwing off the coverlet, she wrung her hands, and
declared she must forth to the walls, that war had
come, that the enemy was in the city, that Zion was
perishing. Her son&rsquo;s prophecy was being fulfilled,
the king of the north had come. She struggled to her
feet. Then her knees gave way beneath her. I caught
her as she fell, bore her back to bed, and persuaded
her that it was all a dream, that the shouting and the
hosannas were but the illusion of fever. She seemed
to believe me, lying with open eyes, and listening to
the muffled clamor from the street.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>&rsquo;Tis wondrous strange. But what has thus confused
her?</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>In her sickness she craves for her son.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>Jeremiah, the madman! The zealot of the streets.
She herself drove him from the house.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Not for an hour since has she known happiness. She
sat ever in silence, or stood at the door like one awaiting
a guest. When he failed to return, her mind
gradually became confused.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" title="144"> </a>Jochebed</p>

<p>Why then comes he not, the reprobate, that he may
restore her to health? He tramps the streets spewing
curses among the people, while his mother is dying for
lack of him. Why comes he not, chatterer in the
market, slayer of peace?</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>He knows naught of her longing. No less proud
is he than she, and he will never cross the threshold
until he is summoned.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>Summon him then.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>How dare I without her command? I am but a
servingman. How can I act upon words which she
mutters unwitting?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>You may and you must, since her life is at stake.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Do you believe I should do rightly to summon
Jeremiah without awaiting her command?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>By God&rsquo;s mercy I believe it. Thus will you save
her alive.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" title="145"> </a>Ahab</p>

<p>God be praised, Jochebed. In my sore need I have
already done what you wish.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>A blessing on you therefor!</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>I have sent my boys seeking him.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>If they can but find him. Lacking him, she will die
of mingled pride and longing.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Truly, since she drove him forth, she has been
unceasingly at war with herself.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>Who is at peace in this stormy time?</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">The mother wakens with a sigh</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Speaking softly to <span class="speaker">Ahab</span></span>] Ahab, she stirs, she is
waking. Her eyes are still closed, but her lips move
as if to speak.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" title="146"> </a>The Mother</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Speaks with closed eyes, the tones of her voice like

Is he here? Where is he, the son of my sorrow?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Whispering</span>] How wonderful! For the first time
she speaks of him plainly.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Nay, she is still dreaming.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Moves and opens her eyes</span>] Are you there, Ahab?
Is that you Jochebed? My dreams are dark and
uneasy.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Tenderly</span>] How do you feel? Have you slept
well?</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>How can I sleep well, when my dreams are so
dreadful? Where is he? I saw him. Why did he
go away?</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Whom do you mean?</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>Why did he go away? Why did you let him go
away?</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_147" title="147"> </a>Ahab</p>

<p>There has been no one in the room but Jochebed
and me.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>Not he? Not he? The house is haunted with
dreams. [<span class="stage-direction">She sits up suddenly in bed, glancing round
with feverish anxiety</span>] Why do you not summon him?</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Summon whom?</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>How can you ask? Can you not see that death&rsquo;s
hand is upon me? Yet you will not send for him.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>How should I dare&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>Alas, that I should be immured here, too ill to move,
tended by blind servants with hearts of stone. Away,
away.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>But mistress&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>You have betrayed me. You have forbidden him
the house. I know he must have come, and you have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" title="148"> </a>
barred the door. He has been here. My instinct
tells me. He waits but the summons, and you will
not send. You have denied him entry.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Hearken, mistress&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>Woe is me! Away! May you die as I am dying,
abandoned by your children; may you die in the straw
like an outcast.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Let me say a word&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>One word only will I listen to, that he is coming,
that he is here.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>That is what I would fain tell you. He is coming.
His footsteps draw nigh.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Rapturously</span>] He is coming, my Jeremiah? Deceive
me not, Ahab. Cheat not a dying woman.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>Ahab has already sent his sons to seek out Jeremiah.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" title="149"> </a>The Mother</p>

<p>He is coming. Is it true? Yes, I hear him. I
hear his footfall. I hear him in the house. He knocks
at the door, knocks within my heart. Hasten, man,
hasten. Why do you tarry to admit him?</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Endeavoring to calm her</span>] Mistress, he will be here
anon. Early this morning did I send my boys.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">In excitement once more</span>] Nay, he will not come.
Your lads are slothful, and are idling in the streets.
Would they but hasten. The darkness gains on me.
If I could but see him ere I sink into it. Run, Ahab,
he may be at the door.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Have patience, you will do yourself a harm.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>Why do you not let him in? Can you not hear how
he is hammering at the door? I feel it in my temples.
Open to him, open.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ahab</p>

<p>Not yet is he here, but he will come ere long.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jochebed</p>

<p>He will soon be here. Have patience a while.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" title="150"> </a>The Mother</p>

<p>No, no; he is there, but you are keeping him from
me. My time is short. My limbs are cold&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

anon.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Catching sight of <span class="speaker">Jeremiah</span>, he starts and stops

silent? [<span class="stage-direction">She suddenly gives a cry of joy</span>] Has he
come? Is my Jeremiah here? Where are you,
Jeremiah?</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Hesitatingly, <span class="speaker">Jeremiah</span> moves forward a few
steps. He, too, is a prey to strong emotion</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Stretching out her arms towards him</span>] You are
there, I feel it. Would that I could see you clearly.
Why come you not close, that I may touch you?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Not moving, his hands still clenched</span>] I dare not, I
dare not. Disaster dogs my footsteps. Curses go
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_151" title="151"> </a>
before me. Let me stand thus apart, lest my breath
harm you, lest it strike terror to your soul.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Feverishly</span>] My child, my arms crave for you.
Come close, dear, come close. Are my lips so hateful
to you? Is my hand so estranged?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>I am estranged from myself, and a stranger in this
house.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>Alas, he repels me, will leave me once more. What
makes you so cold, so hard-hearted?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>A word burns between us like the sword of the angel
of God.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>The curse, for which I have cursed myself a thousand
times? Idle breath was it, and the wind has
blown it away.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Nay, Mother, the curse stands, and all the streets
are filled with it. It rebounds from the wall of every
house, attacks me from all men&rsquo;s mouths. No longer
am I your son, no longer living flesh, but the mock of
the world, an outcast from my people, hated by the
righteous, forgotten by God, loathed by myself. To
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_152" title="152"> </a>
myself leave me. Let me remain in the darkness,
most accurst of all men.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Mother</p>

<p>My child, were you indeed the rejected of all men,
banned by the priests, outlawed by the people; had
God himself thrust you away from the light of his
countenance; still were you my son, blood of my blood
for evermore. I will love you for their hatred, and
bless you for their curse. If they have spit upon you,
come that I may kiss you; if they have cast you out,
come that I may take you in; home, come home to my
heart. Sweet to me is the bitterness of your lips, sweet
the salt of your tears; blessed is all that you do; if only
you return to my mother&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Falling to his knees with a groan</span>] Mother, spirit of
eternal kindness. Mother, you give me back my lost
world.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">The mother folds him in her arms, and clasps him
without speaking for a time. Tremblingly she strokes
his head and his body again and again. At length, as
she looks at him, a strange glow of happiness lights up
her face, and she speaks to him in a plaintive chant</span>]</p>

<p>You who have misled Israel, would you tempt me to
say No when God says Yes, and Yes when God says
No? More strongly hath he tempted me to depart
from his ways, yet would I not depart from them.
He raised up one against me whose breath was dearer
to me than the breath of my own life, but I would not
yield to her, for the Lord cuts from the tree of life
him whom he hath chosen for a scourge. Go, and
leave me in peace.</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p>You shall be lowered into a pit, that you may no

<div class="scene-description">
<p><span class="speaker">King Zedekiah&rsquo;s</span> bed-chamber, large and stately.
It is dimly lighted, so that details are scarcely visible.
What light there is comes from a lamp hanging in a
golden bowl, and from the soft moonbeams which
stream in through the casement. This is widely open
and commands a view of the town. In the foreground
stands a large table surrounded by broad seats.
The curtained bed occupies the center of the background.
<span class="speaker">Zedekiah</span> is standing motionless at the
window, looking down on the moonlit city. <span class="speaker">Joab</span>, a
young spearman, enters, and stands respectfully waiting
for the king to notice him. <span class="speaker">Zedekiah</span> pays no
heed, but continues to gaze out of the window.</p>
</div>

<p class="speaker">The Lad</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">After a pause ventures to speak</span>] My Lord King!
[<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">Zedekiah</span> turns with a start</span>] It is midnight, O King.
This is the hour at which thou orderedst me to summon
the council.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Are they all here?</p>

<p class="speaker">The Lad</p>

<p>All, at thy command.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" title="178"> </a>Zedekiah</p>

<p>Have they come unseen by the people and by the
palace servants?</p>

<p class="speaker">The Lad</p>

<p>Unseen, Lord King. By secret ways I led them
hither.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Where is the spy? Hast thou kept him apart?</p>

<p class="speaker">The Lad</p>

<p>He tarries with the doorkeepers.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Let him tarry. Summon the council.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">The Lad</span> bows, and disappears through the
doorway</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Strides to and fro, and then returns to the window.
He soliloquizes</span>] Never have I seen the stars shine so
brightly. They stand confusedly in rows, like letters
on the dark background of heaven, a writing which no
man can read. In Babylon, they say, are interpreters
and priests who serve the stars, conversing with them
by night. Other kings can talk with their gods; they
have shrines on their towers where they can learn the
will of heaven when their hearts are troubled. Why
have I no soothsayers who can tell the future? It is
terrible to be the servant of a god who is always silent;
whom no one has ever seen! [<span class="stage-direction">A pause while he contemplates
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_179" title="179"> </a>
the city</span>] They are all asleep, those over
whom I rule; they rest beside their wives or beside
their weapons; in me is centered their need and their
wakefulness. I must counsel others, but who shall
counsel me? I must lead others, but who shall lead
me? I am exalted over others, but over me is exalted
one whom I cannot see. Below is sleep; above is
silence.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">The Lad</span> draws aside the curtain; and the five
councilors enter noiselessly. They are <span class="speaker">Pashur</span>, the
high priest; <span class="speaker">Hananiah</span>, the prophet; <span class="speaker">Imre</span>, the oldest
burgher; <span class="speaker">Abimelech</span>, the general; <span class="speaker">Nahum</span>, the
steward. <span class="speaker">Zedekiah</span> turns to receive them. They
bow</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>I summoned you by night that our talk might be
private. I demand from you a pledge of secrecy.
Lay your hands within the priest&rsquo;s hands; he will
answer for you to the Most High. [<span class="stage-direction">Silently they raise
their hands in adjuration, and each in turn lays his
hand in <span class="speaker">Pashur&rsquo;s</span></span>] I swear by Almighty God that I
will show no anger against any who opposes me.
[<span class="stage-direction">He lays his hand in <span class="speaker">Pashur&rsquo;s</span></span>] Now let us take
counsel. [<span class="stage-direction">He waves them towards the table, and all
take their seats</span>] We are in the eleventh month of the
siege. The vines are green once more. Nebuchadnezzar
has been unable to take Jerusalem, but we on
our part have not been able to force him to raise the
siege. His sword against us beats the water, but so
likewise does ours beat the water against him. We
have left nothing undone that might bring aid. I
have sent envoys to the king of the Medes; I have
sent to the princes of the east, asking their help against
Ashur. The missions were fruitless. We stand alone.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_180" title="180"> </a>Hananiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Fiercely</span>] God is on our side.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">The others say nothing</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Quietly</span>] God is on our side. He has set up his
tabernacle upon this hill, and my own roof stands in
the shadow of his holy house. But God sends trials
upon his own people. Those who swore faith to us,
betrayed us; the Egyptians abandoned us; we are
alone. Let us take counsel together, how to fight out
our quarrel with Nebuchadnezzar, or whether we can
find a means to end it.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>Let us pray to God for a miracle. Let our hearts
overflow with prayer, our altars smoke with sacrifices.
What we have done once hitherto, let us now do twice
over.</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>There is nothing left to sacrifice, neither bulls nor
rams.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>It is false. I have heard the lowing of the cattle
which you refuse to deliver up to the sacrifice.</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>The last we have. They are milch cows to provide
food for nursing mothers and the sick.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" title="181"> </a>Hananiah</p>

<p>Such thrift is impious where God is concerned. Let
the sick starve and the breasts of the women run dry,
so long as God receives due meed of sacrifice.</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Earnestly</span>] God requires no gifts to make him
aware of our distresses.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>Naught is sweeter to the Lord than the gifts of the
needy. We should give to the uttermost, tearing the
morsels from our own mouths.</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p>I know the customs. It is not for you, Hananiah,
to teach me my duty, which I know better perchance
than you know God&rsquo;s word and God&rsquo;s will.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>Who sacrifices grudgingly, who sacrifices with a
cold heart, is but a slaughterman, and no true servant
of the Lord. Lo, I say unto you unless ye give of
your uttermost need, ye are unworthy to stand in the
light of his countenance.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Passionately</span>] Hold your peace. Your words are
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_182" title="182"> </a>
past bearing. But a few grains of sand have run
through the hour glass, and already you rail against
one another. We do not meet to discuss what it is
fitting we should render unto God. We meet to consider
our pressing need, and how we can relieve it.
We are in the throes of war, and to you therefore I
turn first for counsel, Abimelech, general of my army.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>Stout are the walls of Jerusalem, O King, but stouter
still is my heart.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>And your men, old stalwart; are they, too, stout-hearted?
Rarely do I hear them raise exultant cries.
When I pass among them, no longer do they strike
their shields. They turn away their faces.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>War makes men silent, but it steels their hearts. No
longer, indeed, do they shout with delight, for that
they can use their swords freely. Custom stales all
joys. But they watch and wait; strong as brass are
they, guarding the walls of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>But what if the moons still wax and wane; what if
the second year of the siege begins? There is no
help coming from outside.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_183" title="183"> </a>Abimelech</p>

<p>The siege will last as long as God pleases, and we
shall last as long as the siege.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>May the Lord fulfil thy words. [<span class="stage-direction">To the others</span>]
Are ye all of the same opinion?</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p>We must be steadfast, enduring patiently until the
end.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>What sayest thou, Hananiah?</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>Never shall Nebuchadnezzar overthrow us. Woe
unto all faint-hearts. Did it rest with me, I would
put them to the sword.</p>

<p class="speaker">Imre</p>

<p>Mine eyes are dim with age, but being old, I saw the
days when Senaccherib was arrayed against Israel, and I
saw his men lying dead in heaps around our walls.
Never were the jackals so fat as in the year when
Jerusalem was encircled by the enemies of the Lord.
The same may happen again to those who now besiege
us. Let mine eyes not be wholly darkened ere this
day dawn. Jerusalem endureth for ever!</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_184" title="184"> </a>Abimelech, Hananiah, Pashur</p>

<p>Jerusalem endureth for ever!</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">A pause</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Thou sayest nothing, Nahum. Wherefore art thou
silent?</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>Gloomy are my thoughts, Lord King, and bitter will
be my speech. He thrusts not himself forward, to
whom joy is lacking.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>I summoned you in council, one and all. Welcome
is the bearer of good tidings, but no less welcome he
who brings wise warnings. Speak freely.</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>Shortly before you called me to the council, I was
visiting the storehouses, and having the grain measured,
bushel by bushel. They were full when the siege
began, but now they are almost empty. No longer
can we provide a whole loaf for the day&rsquo;s ration.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">All sit in dismayed silence</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Was there not ample provision of grain from the
villages? Was not an abundance of milch cows and
other beasts driven within the walls?</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_185" title="185"> </a>Nahum</p>

<p>Forget not that the siege has lasted nearly a year,
and that there are many mouths to feed.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">After another pause</span>] We can reduce the rations yet
further. Let nothing be wasted.</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>Long have we been careful to avoid waste. Yet the
storehouses gape with emptiness. Time is a mighty
eater.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>How long, then, thinkest thou, ere famine is upon
us?</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">In low tones</span>] Three weeks, Lord. No more.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">A pause</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Three weeks &hellip; And then?</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>How can I answer thee, O King? God alone knows
the answer. [<span class="stage-direction">Renewed silence</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">In great excitement</span>] Cut the loaves in half. Cut
them in three, and let that suffice for the day. Too
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_186" title="186"> </a>
long have they lived riotously, they and their concubines;
let them grow lean, now, fighting the Lord&rsquo;s
fight.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>My soldiers must not have their food cut down. No
man can fight on an empty stomach.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>We must all share and share alike, the soldiers as
well as the others. Jerusalem is at stake.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>My men must have their strength kept up. Let the
useless mouths go hungry, the windbags and the
prattlers.</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>You talk folly. What would it avail to pinch ourselves
unduly, seeing that there are an hundred thousand
within the walls. There is food to last us three
weeks. If we slaughter the beasts reserved for the
temple, we can hold out a fortnight more.</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p>Let us keep the peace among ourselves. Ye rail
against one another like enemies. Let us stand united
against Nebuchadnezzar and likewise against our own
people. Neither he nor they must know aught of our
need.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_187" title="187"> </a>Zedekiah</p>

<p>What if he know it already?</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>None can know it. Daily I set my seal on the doors
of the storehouses. Neither the people nor Nebuchadnezzar
can be aware of our distress.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>God be praised. Nebuchadnezzar would show us no
mercy if he knew.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">After a pause</span>] I have called you in council, elders
of the people. Wars are not ended by the sword alone.
I have summoned you to ask whether I should send
an envoy to Nebuchadnezzar, praying him that there
should be peace between our nations.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>No peace with the blasphemers of the Almighty!</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>Let him make the first offer.</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p>I think it would be dangerous for us to begin.
Should we open the parley, he would seek to make
slaves of us.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_188" title="188"> </a>Zedekiah</p>

<p>I hold other views. Though as yet he knows nothing
of our desperate plight, it can remain hidden for a few
days only. We must turn these days to account.</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>True are thy words, O King. We must seek mercy
of Nebuchadnezzar before he triumphs over us with
the sword.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Bitterly</span>] Sue for mercy! Death were better!</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p>We need God&rsquo;s mercy, not man&rsquo;s.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">To <ins title="Nahum"><span class="speaker">Nahum</span></ins></span>] Coward and traitor!</p>

<p class="speaker">Imre</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Wearily</span>] When will you cease quarreling? The
king&rsquo;s words are true. It would be folly to wait till the
last hour. Let us seek parley while we can still show
a bold front.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>It is too late. The dead lying before the walls will
cry reproach on us.</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p>It is too late. The war has heaped up such mountains
of hatred.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_189" title="189"> </a>Zedekiah</p>

<p>Nay, it is not too late. [<span class="stage-direction">He pauses for a moment</span>]
An envoy has already passed between Nebuchadnezzar
and me.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">The councilors spring excitedly to their feet</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>Thou hast received an envoy from Nebuchadnezzar?
Blessed be the hour.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>Traitor! Thou holdest parley with the enemy!</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>No treaty without our consent! Thou hast forgotten.</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p>Thou hast held parley, King, without consulting us?
Why then are we summoned in council?</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Peace, peace. Can ye not wait till I have finished?
Ye snap at my first word like a pack of hungry hounds.
[<span class="stage-direction">A pause. He continues more quietly</span>] A messenger
has come from Nebuchadnezzar. I have not yet heard
the message. Is this to hold parley? Is this treachery?
Answer!</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">All are silent for a while</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" title="190"> </a>Pashur</p>

<p>I crave thy pardon, King. It is hard to weigh one&rsquo;s
words when so much hangs in the balance.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>It is for you to decide; for you to hear the envoy,
or to send him away unheard.</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>Our position is desperate. We must hear him.</p>

<p class="speaker">Imre</p>

<p>We can listen to his message, and be cautious about
accepting it.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>We can hear him, and can settle afterwards whether
we will let him return. He may be sent only to spy
out the land.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>What say ye, Pashur and Hananiah?</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p>Let us hear him.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">Hananiah</span> is silent and averts his face</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Since no one opposes, we will hear the message.
[<span class="stage-direction">Going to the doorway he calls out</span>] Joab, fetch the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_191" title="191"> </a>
envoy. [<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">Zedekiah</span> returns to the table</span>] Let each
ask what questions he will. But our answers must show
one mind.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">Baruch</span> is ushered in by <span class="speaker">Joab</span>. The latter passes
out again, replacing the curtain. <span class="speaker">Baruch</span> bows before
the king</span>]</p>

<p>Dost thou bring a message to Israel from King
Nebuchadnezzar?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>He has sent me with a message to thee, O King.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>These are my councilors. Who speaks to me speaks
to them also, for they and I, Israel and Israel&rsquo;s king,
are at one by God&rsquo;s will. [<span class="stage-direction">Turning to the others</span>]
Question him.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hananiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Scornfully</span>] What grace does the king of the
heathen vouchsafe&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Interrupting</span>] Let us consider practical matters
first! What is your name?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>Baruch, son of Zebulon, of the house of Naphtali.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>Are you then of our blood?</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_192" title="192"> </a>Baruch</p>

<p>I am a servant of the one God, and was born in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>Does anyone here know this man?</p>

<p class="speaker">Pashur</p>

<p>I know his father, a just man, and a faithful servant
of the Lord.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>How did you fall into the enemy&rsquo;s hands?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>I was drawing water from Moria well when they
seized me.</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>What proof have you that you are an envoy? Have
you a letter, signed and sealed?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar gave me his signet ring, that I
might pass the sentries going and returning. [<span class="stage-direction">He
shows the ring on his finger.</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>I have no more questions to ask. Let him deliver
his message.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>When the Assyrian soldiers waylaid me, they took
me to the king&rsquo;s tent. Nebuchadnezzar has kept me
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_193" title="193"> </a>
under guard these eleven months. Sending for me
yesterday, he said: &ldquo;Wilt thou take my message to
King Zedekiah?&rdquo; Standing before him without fear,
I answered: &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; Then spake Nebuchadnezzar:
&ldquo;Eleven months have I laid siege to this town. I have
sworn that not again will I lie with woman until the
gates of Jerusalem have been opened. But I will wait
no longer. Should King Zedekiah wish for terms,
let him hasten. Never has an enemy withstood me
more stoutly. To none will I be more gentle than
to him, should he hasten to sue for mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar is a great warrior. It is an honor
to have held out against him for eleven months.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>He said further: &ldquo;If ye open the gates and humble
yourselves ere the moon be full, I will grant you your
lives. Every man may dwell in safety under his vine
and under his fig tree. Though ye have shed our
blood, I seek not yours, but only victory and renown.
It is my will that from sunrise to sunset the nations
should learn the news that none can withstand my
sword; that there is no king but shall bow before me,
the king of kings. I need but a sign, and your city
shall be safe, your days long in the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="speaker">Nahum</p>

<p>Methinks the terms are easy.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" title="194"> </a>Pashur</p>

<p>Too easy for me to trust them.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>But the sign! What sign does Nebuchadnezzar
demand?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>He said: &ldquo;Zedekiah, who has taken up arms against
me, must abase himself. When I enter the city, let
him walk to meet me, from the gates of the temple to
the wall, carrying his crown in his hands, and wearing
a wooden yoke on his neck&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Drawing himself up</span>] A yoke?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>&ldquo;A yoke that all men may know his stubbornness is
broken and his pride humbled. I will meet him, will
lift the yoke from his neck, and replace the crown on
his head.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Never shall the man wear a crown whose neck has
borne a yoke. Never! [<span class="stage-direction">He rises to his feet</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Abimelech</p>

<p>I could not endure it! [<span class="stage-direction">He also rises</span>]</p>

<p>He spake unto me and said: &ldquo;I will take the yoke
from the king&rsquo;s neck and restore the crown to his head.
He shall walk at my left hand, that men may know I
honor him as my royal brother. But there is still one
within your walls, of whom folk say that he is mightier
than any. I would see this mighty one. They say
that there is a god within your walls, whose countenance
ye hide behind the curtains of a tabernacle, for that no
one can bear to look upon him. To me, fear is
unknown, and I wish to enter his presence, that I may
behold him. I will not lay hands on his altar, nor
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_199" title="199"> </a>
touch his bread, neither will I covet his treasures. One
thing only do I ask, that I may enter his tabernacle,
for I would fain set eyes on him who hath proved
mightier than I.&rdquo; Thus spake Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar demands an answer to-day?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>Yea, Lord; for to-morrow the moon is full.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Paces the floor again. Then abruptly</span>] Thou
sawest him face to face. Did he ask thee anything
concerning me?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>His chief counselor and his scribe were present.
The former asked me about you, but Nebuchadnezzar
bade him be silent.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Full of pride is he, and his wrath is like a storm over
our heads. But I fear him not. Himself, he asked
nothing concerning me?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>Nothing, Lord King.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_205" title="205"> </a>Zedekiah</p>

<p>To him we are naught. To him our walls are but a
handful of dust. Yet we can meet defiance with defiance.
For eleven months he has been breaking his
teeth against the ramparts of the city, and he would
dismiss us with a smile. I am not worth a word, and
he rates our town at a breath. Nevertheless my yoke
is not yet ready; the walls of Jerusalem still stand.
We have taught him to wait, but he has not yet learned
his lesson. Shall I be the slave of his caprices? He
would tarry but a day? Let him tarry for weeks and
months. [<span class="stage-direction">Drawing himself up</span>] Take this message
to Nebuchadnezzar. Say unto him&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">In alarm</span>] Decide not in anger, King Zedekiah.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Rigid with astonishment</span>] How darest thou interrupt
me?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Kneels</span>] I implore thee, save Jerusalem. Stretch
forth thine hand in peace, lest the walls crumble and
the temple be shattered. Lord King, I adjure thee,
open the gates, open thy heart.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Wrathfully</span>] &ldquo;Open the gates, open thy heart&rdquo;.
I have heard those words before. They have been put
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_206" title="206"> </a>
into thy mouth. One stands behind thee speaking
against me with thy voice.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>Nay, Lord King. My supplication arises from the
depths of my heart. Something will I tell thee, which
hitherto I have withheld. It was not at Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s
summons that I went to him, but of my own
free will, hoping that I might soften his heart. I saw
that either side waited for the other to propose peace.
Day after day, for eleven long months, did I importune
him till he sent me with this message.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Thou, a boy, a child? While we were holding counsel,
thou soughtest out the king of kings to seek peace
and ensure it?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>This did I, O King, in the urgency of my heart&rsquo;s
wishes.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Regards him fixedly for a time. Then, speaking
sharply</span>] Not thine own deed, this, nor thy thought.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>I went at no man&rsquo;s orders.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Thou speakest falsely. No boy could conceive such
a deed for himself.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" title="207"> </a>Baruch</p>

<p>I swear to thee that I did it unadvised. He knew
naught of it, neither commanded it nor approved.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>He? Who is he of whose orders thou speakest?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Evasively</span>] My teacher, my master.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Who is thy master, who? I would know who issues
commands to the boys of this city.</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s servant and prophet is my master. Men call
him Jeremiah.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Furiously</span>] Jeremiah, always Jeremiah. Ever the
shadow that follows my deeds, ever in revolt against
me. I have cast him into a dungeon, but still, as in the
beginning, rises his clamor for peace. Why this persecution?
Why?</p>

<p class="speaker">Baruch</p>

<p>Thou art mistaken. Jeremiah hath more love for
thee than for any other in this town.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" title="208"> </a>Zedekiah</p>

<p>I need not his love. I spew forth his love, and I
despise his anger. Who is he, that he should dare to
love me? Shall one venture to stand up in the streets
and give tongue, declaring that he loveth me, or loveth
me not? Why should Jeremiah push in twixt me and
my resolve? Would he show himself the greater of
us twain? I am the king, I alone! Let him cry,
Peace, peace! Not in his hand lieth the fate of Jerusalem.
I am king in Zion, and never shall he boast
that he frightened me with his dreams. Better the
city should perish, than be saved by the hand of Jeremiah.
Go thou to Nebuchadnezzar and say unto him:
Never will Zedekiah bear a yoke. Never shall the
king of Ashur raise the curtain before the holy of
holies. Nebuchadnezzar may come with all his men;
he will find Zedekiah ready to meet him.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">Baruch</span> raising both hands imploringly, is about to
speak. <span class="speaker">Zedekiah</span> continues</span>]</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Again <span class="speaker">Baruch</span> endeavors to speak</span>]</p>

I command thee, away!</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">Baruch</span> stands for a moment, and then, veiling his
face, passes out. <span class="speaker">Zedekiah</span> draws himself up threateningly
when <span class="speaker">Baruch</span> hesitates. As soon as the young
man has gone, the king lowers his outstretched arm,
and his countenance is once more shadowed with

dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">Joab</span> brings a pitcher and fills a silver goblet.
<span class="speaker">Zedekiah</span> empties it at a draught. Then he listens,
and his face is again clouded</span>]</p>

<p>Who is walking outside there? I hear footsteps.
Does the spy still tarry?</p>

<p class="speaker">Joab</p>

<p>He has gone forth, Lord. You hear the sentry, my
brother Nehemiah.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Tell him to tread softly when he is on guard outside
my bedchamber at night. I need sleep just as much
as other men.</p>

<p class="speaker">Joab</p>

<p>I will see to it, Lord. [<span class="stage-direction">He draws aside the curtains

<p>[<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">Joab</span> calls <span class="speaker">Nehemiah</span>. Silently the two stand at
the head of the bed, motionless figures holding spears.
In the moonlight their shadows rise in giant silhouettes
on the wall. The only sound is the gentle plashing
of a fountain in the court-yard</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Springing up with a wild cry</span>] Why do ye whisper
together? Did I not command ye to silence?</p>

<p class="speaker">Joab</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Alarmed</span>] We said nothing, Lord King.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Some one is talking. Who is it that devours my
slumber? All should sleep, so that I too may sleep. Is
there anyone awake in the neighboring rooms?</p>

<p class="speaker">Joab</p>

<p>No one, Lord King. Nor anywhere throughout the
palace.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_211" title="211"> </a>Zedekiah</p>

towers of care? Get me wine.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">Joab</span> fills the goblet once more. <span class="speaker">Zedekiah</span> drains
it and flings it away. With a groan he lies down again.
All is still save for the murmur of the fountain. <span class="speaker">Zedekiah</span>,
who has been lying motionless on the bed, now
very quietly sits up in the gloom. Crouching like a
wild beast about to spring, he listens intently. Then
he suddenly screams</span>]</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Some one is speaking. I hear a voice which drones
unendingly. I have given orders that none shall speak
in my house. The voice is chanting. But I have forbidden
that any should sing under my roof. Do ye not
hear it?</p>

<p class="speaker">Joab</p>

<p>I hear nothing, Lord.</p>

<p class="speaker">Nehemiah</p>

<p>No sound has reached me.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Glares at the two lads. Crouching he listens for a
moment, and breaks forth again</span>] I hear it, I tell you;
an interminable monotone. Listen, Joab, here where
I am listening. It is somewhere beneath us, burrowing
like a mole in the darkness of my slumber, devouring
my sleep. Canst not hear, lad?</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_212" title="212"> </a>Joab</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Listens intently for a moment, and then shudders</span>]

of one singing. The spirits of the deep are awake
beneath the house. The voice laments and moans like
a caged beast.</p>

<p class="speaker">Nehemiah</p>

<p>Perchance it is but the wind moaning through a
cranny.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>I hear words; I feel them without understanding
them. Who dares to sing by night in my house? Is it
so well with my slaves that they must sing while I toss
sleepless? Away, Joab, and silence the disturber.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">Joab</span> hastens out. <span class="speaker">Zedekiah</span> crouches, listening.
He seems at first to hear something. Then he raises
his head, and subsequently lowers it to listen once more.
Suddenly three dull blows are heard. The king listens
eagerly. He draws a breath of relief</span>]</p>

<p>God be praised, the voice is stilled.</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction"><span class="speaker">Joab</span> reenters with troubled mien</span>]</p>

<p>Who was talking?</p>

<p class="speaker">Joab</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Trembling</span>] I know not, Lord, I did not find him.
As I neared the marketplace, the noise of singing came
to me louder, rising as it were from the depths of the
earth. I followed the direction of the sound. There
was no one singing in the marketplace. The utterance
had a hollow ring, as if it came from a well or from a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_213" title="213"> </a>
pit. Now I could hear the words, and they were terrible.
Thrice did I strike the ground with the haft
of my spear. Then was the Gehenna silent.</p>

others sleep?</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_216" title="216"> </a>Jeremiah</p>

<p>He may not sleep who watches over the people. The
Lord hath appointed me to watch and to give warning.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Jeremiah, I have summoned thee to hold counsel
with me. No man knoweth that to this end I have
drawn thee from the pit where thou hast been prisoned.
Wilt thou advise me truly?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>God helping me, I will.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Know, then, what none other knows save my innermost

seeking to end the war between our nations.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Exultantly</span>] God be praised! Open the gates,
open thy heart to humbleness.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Rejoice not too soon. Hard are the terms and
measureless is the arrogancy of the king of Ashur.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Arrogant hast thou been towards him, therefore must
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_217" title="217"> </a>
thou accept arrogancy in return. Put compulsion on
thy heart, so thou save Jerusalem from destruction.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>He asks my honor.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Sacrifice thine honor for the city.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Is not honor my office; is not pride my crown?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>If they be truly thine, cast them from thee. Peace
is better than honor; suffering is better than death.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>He would bow my neck beneath a yoke.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Blessed is he who suffers for all; who suffers that
all may live. Bow thy neck, and save the city.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>I should bring shame on all the kings whose throne

forefathers.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_218" title="218"> </a>Jeremiah</p>

<p>Not me alone will Nebuchadnezzar abase, but God
also.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>God smiles at those who would abase him. Open
the gates, open thy heart to humbleness.</p>

not avert it. Open the gates, open thy heart to

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Angrily</span>] Thy wisdom is stubbornness; thy counsel,
insolence. With deaf ears dost thou hearken, and
thine answer is hard as flint.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

sayest? Feigning to ask counsel, thou wouldst have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_219" title="219"> </a>
naught but flattery. May my tongue consume away
in my mouth, my bones fall apart, ere I praise thy folly

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Why railest thou thus, when thou hast not yet heard
my purpose?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>I know thy purpose. With words dost thou fawn on
me, whilst thy will is set up against me. Wouldst
mock me, and play with God&rsquo;s word? Thou hast not
summoned me to help thee decide. Long ere this has
the message been signed and sealed within thy soul.
Thou mayst deceive thyself, King of Israel, but me
thou canst not deceive.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>Jeremiah!</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Yea, verily, I, Jeremiah, say unto thee, the king:
Thou dealest falsely with me, and thy words are a
blind. No longer is thy will free, nor dost thou truly
desire me to influence thy decision.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zedekiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Unsteadily</span>] How canst thou know this?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Thy lips betray thee. Thou quailest before my
wrath like a guilty man. Fain wouldst thou tempt me
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_220" title="220"> </a>

shoulders. Woe unto him who tempts men, for he

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Hesitates, greatly moved. Then he speaks in low

<p>A vast crypt with shutters and doors closed so that
the damp underground space is but dimly lighted.
Fugitives, wan and careworn, are crouching and lying
on the stone flooring. Some of them have gathered
round an elder who is reading from the scriptures. In
the background lies a wounded man, tended by a
woman. Remote from the rest, sitting on a piece of
masonry, and as motionless as if he were himself
carved out of the rock, is <span class="speaker">Jeremiah</span>, his face buried in
his hands. He plays no part in what is going on, so
that his silence is as it were a rock fixed in the current
of plaints and disputes. It is evening, on the day after
the taking of Jerusalem. As the elder reads, he sways
his body rhythmically in time to the words, which are
low and monotonous, except when he raises his voice to
express despair or hope. From time to time, the others
take up the responses.</p>

my brother?&rdquo; Zedekiah called upon his name, the

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Struggling with emotion</span>] It is false. Not by my
will did this happen. Let him not dare to accuse me.
The word came to me; what I said was struck from
me as we strike fire from flint. I wished him no ill.
God made me a liar, resist his power as I would. Not
mine the will that moved me.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Why should the king accuse me? A greater power
than mine constrained my utterance. I was the tool of
the pitiless one, his breath, the slave of his malice. He
commanded, and I had to obey, for his strength is
greater than mine. He breathed curses into my
breath. His was the gall in my speech, his the bitterness
in my spittle. Woe upon the hands of God;
whom he seizes, shall not again be loosed. Ah, would
he but set me free from his curse, that no longer I
might have to speak his words. [<span class="stage-direction">A pause</span>] No longer
will I speak his words. I will hold my peace. [<span class="stage-direction">A

curse thy curses. Lift thy hand from me, take the fire
from my mouth. No more can I bear.</p>

thee, how open my eyes in the morning without
being able to look upon Solomon&rsquo;s house and God&rsquo;s
dwelling. Rather would I be buried in thy earth than
walk at large in another land; rather would I lie dead
with my fathers than live to be the slave of the heathen.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, take me to thy
bosom. As I have been with thee in life, let me be
with thee in death.</p>

<p class="speaker">Zephaniah</p>

<p>In this you and I must part company. Death has

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Raising himself</span>] Yea, let me live, to feel but a
grain of sand between my fingers. To look again upon
the almond blossoms, to see them open as night falls.
To watch the moon waxing and waning in its passage
across the starry heavens. Even if life were to deny
all its joys, even if I were to be crippled and deaf,
yet still might I look upon the glorious things in the
world, still draw the breath of life. Let me feel my
heart beating, the warm blood coursing through my
veins. Give me life, I ask nothing more!</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Suddenly springing to his feet, with an awesome
outburst</span>] God is nowhere! Nowhere at all! Who
among the living hath seen him, who hath heard the
sound of his voice? Those who seek him, seek him
in vain; those who created him, lied before the faces
of men. God is nowhere! Neither in heaven, nor on
earth, nor in the souls of men.</p>

thrown down his walls, and burned his own temple.

Heed him not, ye servants of the Almighty.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Still more fiercely</span>] Who has served him in Israel
as I have served him? Who within Jerusalem&rsquo;s walls
has been more faithful than I? For his sake I left
my home; for his sake I refused to comfort my mother
in death. I have sacrificed friendship to him, and for
his jealousy have I forfeited the love of women. I
have submitted to his will as a wife submits to her
husband. The words that I spake were those which he
put into my mouth; his was the blood in my body; my
thoughts were the children of his will; his were the
dreams that visited my sleep. I gave my back to the
smiters; I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
I served him, I served him, for I believed that through
me he would avert the evil to come. I cursed, thinking
he would turn my curses into blessings. I prophesied,
thinking he would prove me a liar, would save
Jerusalem. But my prophecies have been fulfilled, and
God is proved a liar. Woe is me that I served the
faithless one so faithfully! He sent me that my
brothers should laugh me to scorn while I spat upon
their joys. Now, when misery has befallen them, he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_281" title="281"> </a>
wishes that I in turn should mock their distress. But
I do not laugh, God! I will not laugh at my brothers&rsquo;
torment. Not like thee can I rejoice at another&rsquo;s
sorrow. The odor of the slaughter-house delights not
my nostrils. Too harsh for me is thy harshness, too
heavy thy hand! No longer will I be the instrument
of thy vengeance; no longer will I serve thee. I tear
asunder the bond between thee and me. I tear it
asunder!</p>

<span class="speaker">Jeremiah</span>, recovering composure, regards him
gloomily</span>] I bear a message through my unworthy
mouth from Nebuchadnezzar, my master, king of
kings, destroyer of nations. Thus saith my dread
lord. It hath been reported to Nebuchadnezzar that
thou alone among thy people foretoldest destruction
to the rebels and disgrace to those who goaded on the
people to revolt. Melted like lead are the words of
the priests who withstood thy strength; but thy warning,
like gold, hath endured the test of time. Thy
fame hath reached the ears of Nebuchadnezzar, and
now he is eager to set eyes upon thee. He sendeth
thee raiment such as is worn by the princes of Chaldea,
and will have thee for the chief among his servants
who wait at his table.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>No more will I serve any, either in heaven above or
in the earth beneath, for I have served God and have
wearied of that service. Say unto Nebuchadnezzar
that I refuse to serve him.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Chief Officer</p>

<p>Thou understandest not the words of my lord and
master. Not to any menial service doth he appoint
thee, but would have thee to be the chief over all his
servants. Master of the magicians, astrologers, and
soothsayers, shalt thou be, reading the stars and foretelling
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_290" title="290"> </a>
that which is to come. Second to none shalt
thou be, but shalt come and go in the palace even as
thou wilt.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>I hear your words, and therefrom I learn the king&rsquo;s
wishes. Great is the call of Nebuchadnezzar, but
greater is the need of mine own people. Hearken,
therefore! I enter not the palace where the daughters
of Israel will scour the steps as bondwomen. No
bread do I break as guest at the table of him who hath
profaned the temple of Zion. Not for me the favors
of the cruel, nor the grace of him who hath been
pitiless.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Chief Officer</p>

<p>The message I brought thee was a king&rsquo;s message,
and to kings obedience is due.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>You brought me true word from Nebuchadnezzar.
Render him my answer no less truly. Return to him
who sent you, and say unto him: &ldquo;Thus saith
Jeremiah to Nebuchadnezzar. My bitterness has no
sweetness for thee, nor shall my lips minister to thy
pride. Wert thou to summon me with the tongues of
angels, yet would I not heed thy call; wert thou to
load for me with gold all the stones of Jerusalem, yet
would I not speak soft words to thee. Honor me if
you wilt, to thee I pay not honor. Seek me if thou
wilt, but thee I will not seek.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_291" title="291"> </a>The Chief Officer</p>

<p>Bethink thee, &rsquo;tis the king of kings who summons
thee to enjoy the light of his countenance.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>I refuse to go! I refuse!</p>

<p class="speaker">The Chief Officer</p>

<p>Never before hath any man refused to comply with
the wishes of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Nevertheless I refuse, I, the least among the sons
of Israel. Who is he, that I should fear him? His
power is but a straw, and his wrath but a breath of
wind.</p>

<p class="speaker">The Chief Officer</p>

<p>Rash and presumptuous art thou, to speak thus
lightly of the king my master. Curb thy tongue, and
have a care for thy life.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Fiercely</span>] Who is he that I should fear him?
Many have there been who bore the proud name of
Pharaoh, many whose foreheads were once adorned
with circlets of gold, but no man careth to remember
their deeds, and no man taketh pen to inscribe their
names in the book of time. There have been mightier
than he, whom the generations of men have forgotten
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_292" title="292"> </a>
ere the trees they planted have rotted. Who is
Nebuchadnezzar under the stars, that I should fear
him? Is he not a worm, even as other men? Does
not death dog his footsteps, and corruption await his
body? Shall he escape the finger of time? Think
you that he, more than another, can keep that which
he now hath, or that he can find an issue from the doom
which awaits all the sons of men? Return, therefore,
to your master, bearing from me this message: &ldquo;Woe
to the destroyer, for he shall be destroyed! Woe to
the robber, for he shall be robbed. He who has drunk
his fill of blood, shall be drowned in blood; he who has
battened on the flesh of the nations, shall himself soon
become food for worms! Hearken! A wind is
rising against Babylon, and a tempest is about to break
over Nineveh! Numbered are the days of Ashur.
Drawn is the sword, and it hangs over thee, thy people,
and thy realm. Thou art greedy for news of that
which is to come. Learn, O Nebuchadnezzar, that
Ashur is ripe for destruction; the measure of thine
iniquity is full.&rdquo;</p>

make gestures as if to avert the threatened doom</span>]</p>

<p>Already hath the avenger awakened, for the Lord
hath summoned him, and hath equipped him with
strength. He is coming. Already is he near.
Mighty are his hands; they will crush Babylon like a
bird&rsquo;s nest, and will scatter the people of Ashur like
chaff before the wind. Set watchmen in the towers
upon the walls, that they may warn you of his coming;
send forth men in armor, bearing sharp spears, that
they may resist his onslaught. Just as little as thou
canst blow away the clouds of heaven with thy breath,
just so little canst thou avert the coming of the avenger,
whose sword will slay the children of Ashur.</p>

prophesied.&mdash;Hear him, O Lord, hear him.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">In a frenzy of joy</span>] O fool among fools, didst thou
verily believe thou couldst enslave us; didst thou
verily believe that God would forget us, would forsake
his city of Jerusalem? Are we not his children, his
first-born and his heirs? Is not his spirit upon us, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_294" title="294"> </a>
his blessing upon the seed of Abraham? He has
chastised us for our sins, but will now have pity on us.
What his left hand has taken from us, his right hand
will restore a thousandfold. For know, brothers, that
sooner shall mountains fall and rivers flow upwards,
sooner shall the stars be darkened, than that God shall
forget his covenant, shall abandon Israel, shall turn
away his face from Zion.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Ignoring them in his growing exaltation</span>] How dark
were the days upon earth when God frowned upon his
children. We thought to perish in that darkness, to
go down unto death in our anguish. But with the end
of his wrath came the beginning of his love. A storm
has raged; God has broken our strength like a reed.
But now, once more, the sun of his mercy shines upon
us. He has laid aside the lightnings; he has stilled the
thunder of his voice; his words fall softly on our ears.
Sweet do they sound, sweet and gentle:</p>

<p>Lo, she is risen. She has heard the call. The Lord
has loosened the fetters from her limbs, and has lifted
the yoke from her neck. He has wiped the tears from
her cheeks, has consoled the widows and the orphans.
Smiles succeed to sorrow. The season of blossoming
hath returned. Zion yearns for her children, that
they may look upon her in her happiness and rejoice in
her renewal. Already have the children of Israel
heard the summons of the Lord. Dispersed never so
widely to the ends of the earth and among the islands
of the sea, yet do they return in their myriads to Zion.
From the north and the south, from the east and the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_296" title="296"> </a>
west, the happy pilgrims come. Their footsteps hasten
across the hills of Gilead, eagerly do they make their
way over Bashan and Carmel, that they may see the
city of our love, the city of our suffering, the holy
fortress of Zion. And Jerusalem rejoices to welcome
her children, returned in countless numbers from the
prison-houses of exile. Where the flowers were
withered, new buds are springing; where darkness had
loomed, there shines fresh light; those who have been
dumb, find voice. Jerusalem has risen from the
tomb. The hills nod to her as of old; the shadows of
the mountains lie athwart her plains; as dew gleams in
the meadows, so peace shines in the city, the peace of
the Lord, the peace of Israel, the peace of Jerusalem!</p>

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">A disorderly rout, laughing loudly, issues from
the palace. The newcomers are the princes of Chaldea,
with slaves bearing torches. The princes are drunk.

<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Laughing and shouting, the princes return into the
palace, leaving the man of whom they have been making
sport swaying unsteadily as he stands at the top of
the steps. The moon has pierced the clouds, and his

This gives him the appearance of a gigantic wraith.

<p class="speaker">A Voice</p>

<p>What a life!</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>And I say unto you, who has life, has God also.
Leave it to the dead to complain of those who have led
them to the tomb. We, who survive, should continue
to hope. Lament not, despair not, while breath
remains; neither opening your mouths in revolt, nor
closing your ears to words of consolation.</p>

<p class="speaker">Voices</p>

<p>Words, only words, which avail nothing.&mdash;If you
would lift up our hearts, lift up the walls of Jerusalem.&mdash;Rebuild
the fortress of Zion.&mdash;Alas, he cannot see
our distress, he cannot recognize our suffering.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Brothers, I read your suffering like an open book,
and the scroll of your pain lies unrolled before me.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_316" title="316"> </a>
Natheless, brothers, I see a meaning in this pain and
suffering; I see God therein. The hour is sent to us
for trial. Let us meet the test.</p>

<p class="speaker">Voices</p>

<p>Why should God try us?&mdash;Why should he visit us,
his chosen people, with affliction?&mdash;Why should he
make our burden so heavy?</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>God sends us this trial that we may know him to be
God. To those of other nations, few signs are given
and little recognition is vouchsafed. They fancy themselves
able to see the face of the Eternal in images of
wood and stone. Our God, the God of our fathers, is
a hidden God; and not until we are bathed in sorrow
are we enabled to discern him. He chooses those only
whom he has tried, and to none but the suffering does
he give his love. Let us therefore rejoice at our trials,
brothers, and let us love the suffering God sends. He
has broken us with affliction, that he may sink the deeper
into the freshly ploughed ground of our hearts, and
that we may be ready for the scattering of his seed.
He has weakened our bodies that he may strengthen
our souls. Let us joyfully enter the smelting furnace
of his will, that thereby we may be purified. Follow
the example of your forefathers, and thankfully accept
the scourgings of the Almighty!</p>

<p class="speaker">Voices</p>

<p>Not our will but his.&mdash;A blessing on our trials.&mdash;I
must learn to stifle my complaints.&mdash;True, our forefathers
likewise were in bondage.</p>

<p class="speaker"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_317" title="317"> </a>Jeremiah</p>

<p>Brothers, if we believe that we shall arise, already
we have arisen. What should we be without faith?
Not to us, as to other nations, has a country been given
to which we may cling; a home, where we may tarry;
rest, that our hearts may wax fat! Not for peace have
we been the chosen among the nations. Wandering is
our habitation, trouble our heritage, God our home.
Do not for that reason covet your neighbor&rsquo;s goods; do
not for that reason complain. Leave to others their
happiness and their pride; leave to others an abiding
place. For yourselves, people of suffering, gladly
accept trial. Have faith, chosen of God, seeing that
sorrow is your heritage. Because it is your eternal
heritage, therefore are you chosen.</p>

<p class="speaker">Voices</p>

<p>True is the word.&mdash;Sorrow is our heritage.&mdash;I will
shoulder my burden.&mdash;I have faith in God&rsquo;s mercy.
He will lead us now, as he led us out of Egypt.&mdash;God
will deliver us, as he delivered our fathers.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jeremiah</p>

<p>Arise, then, and cease repining. Take up your faith
as a staff, and you will march bravely through these
trials as you have marched for thousands of years.
Happy are we to be vanquished, and happy to be driven
from home; for we are vanquished, we are driven from
home, by God&rsquo;s will. Happy are we to lose all, that
we may find him; happy is our hard lot, gladsome our
trial. Kings who mastered us have vanished like
smoke; nations which enslaved us have been scattered
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_318" title="318"> </a>
and their seed has been destroyed; towns wherein we
served as bondmen have been made desolate, and are
now the home of the jackal; but Israel still lives, ever
young, for sorrow is our buttress and overthrow is our
strength. Through suffering we have endured the
assaults of time; reverses have ever been our beginning;
and out of the depths God has gathered us to his
heart. Think of our former troubles, and how those
troubles were met. Think of Egypt, the house of
bondage, the first ordeal. Give praise to affliction, ye
afflicted; give praise to trial, ye sorely tried; praise the
name of God who, through tribulation, has chosen us
for all eternity!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
